## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- SCSS
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

More than learned, this was an attempt to remember whatever I learned about basic web development and SCSS last summer. It was all foggy in my mind and I wanted to start again by doing this simple challenge.

### Continued development

I definitely need to work on the structuring of the website, the way I group elements and so on. I feel my CSS is a bit messy and that I could do this much better on a second round if I think over the structure again.
